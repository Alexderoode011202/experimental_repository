North Dayi District (a.k.a. Dayi Dzigbe) is one of the eighteen districts in Volta Region, Ghana.[2] Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger Kpando District on 10 March 1989, until the southern part of the district was split off to create North Dayi District on 28 June 2012; thus the remaining part was elevated to municipal district assembly status to become Kpando Municipal District[3] on the same year. The district assembly is located in the western part of Volta Region and has Anfoega as its capital town.
